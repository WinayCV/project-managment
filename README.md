- Create Projects: Users can create projects with titles and start dates, defining the initial details.
- Manage Tasks: Each project can have a list of tasks with due dates, enabling better organization and tracking of work.
- Track Deadlines: Projects and individual tasks within each project have associated due dates to manage deadlines effectively.


## Features

- **Project Creation**: Users can create new projects specifying titles and start dates.
- **Task Management**: Projects have lists of tasks with due dates for better task organization.
- **Deadline Tracking**: Tasks and projects are associated with due dates to track and manage deadlines.

## Architecture
